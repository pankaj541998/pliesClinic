                            <p class="smalldesc txt-white">Symptoms of a fissure, or anal fissure, can vary in severity but commonly include:

</p>
                            <ul class="service-list starlist hod-list-white">
                                <li>
                                    <b>Anal Pain:- </b>
                                    Pain during or after bowel movements is a hallmark symptom of an anal fissure. The pain is often described as sharp, stabbing, or burning and can persist for hours after defecation.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Rectal Bleeding:-</b>
                                    Bright red blood on toilet paper or in the toilet bowl after a bowel movement is a common symptom of an anal fissure. The bleeding is typically minimal but can sometimes be more noticeable.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Anal Itching:- </b>
                                   Some individuals with anal fissures may experience itching or irritation around the anal area, often due to the presence of stool or moisture.
                                </li>
                                <li>

                                    The muscles around the anus may go into spasms (anal sphincter spasms), causing further pain and discomfort, particularly after bowel movements.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Difficulty Passing Stool:- </b>
                                   The pain associated with anal fissures can make it uncomfortable or difficult to pass stool, leading to constipation or the avoidance of bowel movements altogether, which can exacerbate the condition.

                                 <li>
                                    <b>Tenderness or Swelling:-  </b>
                                  The area around the anus may feel tender or swollen, particularly near the site of the fissure.
                                </li>
                                 <li>
                                    <b>Visible Tear or Crack:- </b>
                                   In some cases, especially during a physical examination, a healthcare provider may be able to see a tear or crack in the lining of the anus.

                            <p class="smalldesc txt-white">It's important to note that while these symptoms are common in anal fissures, they can also indicate other conditions such as hemorrhoids or inflammatory bowel disease.
