                        <p class="smalldesc">An anal fistula is a condition where an abnormal passage forms between the anus and the skin, vagina, or rectum. While it can develop anywhere in the body, the most common occurrence is around the anus. This condition often stems from infected glands within the anus, which can lead to abscesses. Approximately half of these abscesses may progress into fistulas.
