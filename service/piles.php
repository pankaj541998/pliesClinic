                            <p class="smalldesc">It is necessary to remember that while rectal bleeding may be caused due to haemorrhoids, it can also occur due to some life-threatening conditions such as ulcers, diverticulitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and tumors. Hence if rectal bleeding occurs, it is a must to contact the 'House Of Doctors’ for Best Piles Treatment In Mumbai, especially if the person is on blood-thinning medication.</p>
                            <p class="smalldesc">Adhering to the fact that internal piles become inflamed and therefore causes swelling, it is not the only reason leading to pain. Passing a hard stool can too scrape off the thinned lining causing pain and bleeding. However, swollen haemorrhoids can also cause spasm of the muscles that surround the rectum and anus causing pain, especially if they protrude or prolapse through the anus.</p>
                            <p class="smalldesc">External haemorrhoids behave differently since they are covered by regular skin and have pain fibres associated with them. When an underlying vein within the haemorrhoid clots off, it causes intense pain due to the constant stretching of the skin covering the haemorrhoid. It can also result in excess skin tags that can be felt at the anal verge and can cause difficulties with cleaning after a bowel movement, leading to secondary skin infections.</p>
                            <p class="smalldesc">In the later phase, these inflamed haemorrhoids leak mucus that can cause inflammation of the skin surrounding the anus striking burning and itching sensation. There are other causes of these peculiarities that include yeast and other skin infections and parasites like pinworms. Nevertheless, just as blood in the stool should not be ignored because it might be a sign of colon cancer, anal itching or bleeding should not be presumed because it could lead to anal cancer or tumor.</p>
